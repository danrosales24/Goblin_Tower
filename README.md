# Goblin_Tower

a console application that allows the user to play 'Goblin Tower'. The game's scenario is that the main character is a hero walking through a tower infested by goblins. If the hero encounters a goblin, they fight each other until one of them dies. The game ends when the hero dies.

The rules for the game are as follows:

Each new hero starts with random max health points between 20 to 30.
Each new hero will start with a random attack power between 1 to 3.
Each new hero will start with a random defense power between 1-5.
Each new hero will start with an array of potions (int) with a max of 5 slots. Each slot set to 2.
Each new hero will start with 0 gold.
The hero will take a step, and possibly encounter a 'goblin.'
A goblin starts with 5-10 Health points, 2-3 attack power, and 1-2 defense power
If a goblin is found, the hero fights the goblin until either the hero or goblin's health points reach 0.
If the hero wins, reward the hero with 2 gold.
Each potion is worth their value in the array: 1 potion = 2 health points.
Drinking a potion will increase the heroâ€™s health points up to the max random health points assigned at the start of the game.
After every 10 steps:
The hero advances one level in the game.
The hero may visit the "potion shop" to buy more potions for 4 gold each.
When the hero dies, ask the player if they would like to play again.
If the player says yes, create a new character with the same gold they had when they died.
If the player says no, print out the level the current character reached with the number of goblins slain!
